Abstract
This technical report introduces Docling, an easy to use, self-contained, MIT-
licensed open-source package for PDF document conversion. It is powered by
state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table
structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware
in a small resource budget. The code interface allows for easy extensibility and
addition of new features and models.

Introduction
Converting PDF documents back into a machine-processable format has been a major challenge
for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized
characteristic, which discards most structural features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs
and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich
content embedded in PDFs has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful
document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial soft-
ware, cloud offerings [3] and most recently, multi-modal vision-language models. As of today, only
a handful of open-source tools cover PDF conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap
to proprietary solutions.
With Docling, we open-source a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds
on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recog-
nition we developed and presented in the recent past [12, 13, 9]. Docling is designed as a simple,
self-contained python library with permissive license, running entirely locally on commodity hard-
ware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models.
