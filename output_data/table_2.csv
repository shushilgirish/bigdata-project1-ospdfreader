Introduction"
"Converting PDF documents back into a machine-processable format has been a major challenge"
"for decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized"
"characteristic, which discards most
structural
features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs"
"and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich"
"content embedded in PDFs has become ever more relevant.
In the past decade, several powerful"
"document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial soft-"
"ware, cloud offerings
[3] and most recently, multi-modal vision-language models. As of today, only"
"a handful of open-source tools cover PDF conversion,
leaving a significant feature and quality gap"
"to proprietary solutions."
"With Docling, we open-source a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds"
"on the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recog-"
"nition we developed and presented in the recent past
[12, 13, 9]. Docling is designed as a simple,"
"self-contained python library with permissive license, running entirely locally on commodity hard-"
"ware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models."
