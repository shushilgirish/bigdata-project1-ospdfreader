"The Docling pipeline feeds all table objects detected in the layout analysis to the TableFormer model,"
"by providing an image-crop of the table and the included text cells. TableFormer structure predic-"
"tions are matched back to the PDF cells in post-processing to avoid expensive re-transcription text"
"in the table image. Typical
tables require between 2 and 6 seconds to be processed on a standard"
"CPU, strongly depending on the amount of included table cells."
"OCR"
"Docling provides optional
support
for OCR,
for example to cover
scanned PDFs or content
in"
"bitmaps images embedded on a page. In our initial release, we rely on EasyOCR [1], a popular third-"
"party OCR library with support for many languages. Docling, by default,
feeds a high-resolution"
"page image (216 dpi)
to the OCR engine,
to allow capturing small print detail
in decent quality."
"While EasyOCR delivers reasonable transcription quality, we observe that
it
runs fairly slow on"
"CPU (upwards of 30 seconds per page)."
"We are actively seeking collaboration from the open-source community to extend Docling with"
"additional OCR backends and speed improvements."
"3.3
Assembly"
"In the final pipeline stage, Docling assembles all prediction results produced on each page into a"
"well-defined datatype that encapsulates a converted document, as defined in the auxiliary package"
"docling-core.
The generated document object
is passed through a post-processing model which"
"leverages several algorithms to augment features, such as detection of the document language, cor-"
"recting the reading order, matching figures with captions and labelling metadata such as title, authors"
"and references. The final output can then be serialized to JSON or transformed into a Markdown"
"representation at the users request."
"3.4
Extensibility"
"Docling provides a straight-forward interface to extend its capabilities, namely the model pipeline."
"A model pipeline constitutes the central part
in the processing, following initial document parsing"
"and preceding output assembly, and can be fully customized by sub-classing from an abstract base-"
"class (BaseModelPipeline) or cloning the default model pipeline. This effectively allows to fully"
"customize the chain of models, add or
replace models, and introduce additional pipeline config-"
"uration parameters. To use a custom model pipeline,
the custom pipeline class to instantiate can"
"be provided as an argument
to the main document conversion methods. We invite everyone in the"
"community to propose additional or alternative models and improvements."
"Implementations of model classes must satisfy the python Callable interface. The __call__ method"
"must accept an iterator over page objects, and produce another iterator over the page objects which"
"were augmented with the additional
features predicted by the model, by extending the provided"
"PagePredictions data model accordingly."
